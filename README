To run cjdns-dumpweb, ensure:
        That cjdcmd can be run from $PATH
        That cjdcmd has been configured to access the admin server by setting up ~/.cjdnsadmin

A typcical ~/.cjdnsadmin file uses the values from your config and looks something like:
{
    "addr": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 11234,
    "password": "yourpassword"
}

You may then simply run 'sh cjdns-dumpweb' to dump the contents of all websites on port 80 from any address in your routing table that has on running (you may do further parsing from there)
